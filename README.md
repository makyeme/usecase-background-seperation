# Background separation in images

In this group project we explore AI image processing techniques for separating the subject from the background in images. The goal is to build on existing models and methods to get very accurate results. 

This project is a collaboration between [Bram](https://github.com/), [Martin](https://github.com/), [Philippe](https://github.com/).
